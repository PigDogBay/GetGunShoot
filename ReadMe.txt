Story
-----
There's a Zombie on your case, it needs to eat your tasty squishy brain, best run for your gun. Shoot the bugger in its face, up close and personal. Take a breather now? No, this is the night of the Soul Reaper and he will spew another zombie to get you.

Avoid the Soul Reaper's soul traps, for they will rip out your soul to feed the foul Reaper. If a soul trap hits the graveyard, a poor unfortunate lost soul will be collected to feed the ravenous evilness. Do not despair though, you can burst trapped souls and free the poor spirit inside, the souls will fly to heaven and drop you a gift.

Makesure to collect the precious gifts as they are speed boosters, tap fire to run faster. Use them sparingly, the hungry zombie is relentless. Running left or right out of the graveyard will only return warp you back into this dying nightmare.
